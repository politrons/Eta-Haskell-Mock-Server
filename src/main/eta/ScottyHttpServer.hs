--    -- | Evaluate each monadic action in the structure from left to right, and collect the results.
--    Then finally we need to lift the response from insertUser  [IO OK] to [OK] and to do that we use
--    the operator [liftAndCatchIO] which does:
--    -- | Like 'liftIO', but catch any IO exceptions and turn them into Scotty exceptions.
